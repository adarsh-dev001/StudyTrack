User Request Type: syllabus_suggester
Userâ€™s Query/Need: "Generate a detailed, topic-wise weekly study plan for EACH selected subject, broken down into manageable phases leading up to the target completion date. Prioritize high-weightage topics first and consider my preparation level and weak areas."

Instructions:
Based on the above student profile and request type, provide a highly relevant and personalized output. Your response should:
- Match the syllabus and difficulty level of the userâ€™s exam ({{{examType}}}).
- Respect their weak areas ({{{weakTopics}}}), study time ({{{timeAvailablePerDay}}} hours/day), preparation level ({{{preparationLevel}}}), and target date ({{{targetDate}}}).
- Be clear, concise, and practical for the user.
- Break down the syllabus into phases within the weekly schedule for each subject. This means the topics listed per week should naturally progress through different stages of learning (e.g., foundational, core concepts, advanced topics, revision).
- Prioritize high-weightage topics based on typical patterns for the {{{examType}}} exam, adjusting based on the user's preparation level and weak topics.
- The schedule for each subject should be an array of weekly plan objects. Each object in this array must have a 'weekLabel' (string, e.g., "Week 1", "Phase 1 - Week 2") and a 'topics' (array of strings) property.
- For each week, list the topics to be covered for that subject under the 'topics' array. If possible, indicate an estimated study time for topics or ensure the weekly load is reasonable.
- The number of weeks should be realistic based on the target date and average daily study time.
- Calculate the total number of days available from today ({{{currentDate}}}) until the targetDate. Then calculate total study weeks for planning.

**Content Generation Guidelines (for string values in JSON):**
- For \`overallFeedback\`, \`SubjectSyllabusSchema.summary\`, and individual \`topics\` strings:
    - Use clear, engaging, and motivational language.
    - MAY use **bold** (\`**text**\`) or _italic_ (\`*text*\`) for emphasis.
    - MAY incorporate relevant emojis (e.g., ðŸ’¡, âœ…, ðŸš€, ðŸŽ¯).
- Example Topic String: "**Newton's Laws** (Core) - *6h* ðŸš€. Focus on problem-solving."
---

Output a JSON object strictly conforming to the SuggestStudyTopicsOutputSchema.
The 'generatedSyllabus' array must contain one object for each subject listed by the user.
Optionally, include a 'summary' for each subject's plan and 'overallFeedback' for the entire plan.

Example for a single subject in the 'generatedSyllabus' array:
{
  "subject": "Physics",
  "schedule": [
    { "weekLabel": "Phase 1: Foundations - Week 1", "topics": ["**Kinematics** (Important) - *10h*", "Units & Measurement (5h)"] },
    { "weekLabel": "Phase 1: Foundations - Week 2", "topics": ["Laws of Motion (12h) ðŸ’¡", "Work, Energy, Power (8h)"] }
  ],
  "summary": "Phase 1 focuses on building a strong foundation in mechanics. **Practice numericals daily!** Consider your {{{preparationLevel}}} level when tackling these."
}
