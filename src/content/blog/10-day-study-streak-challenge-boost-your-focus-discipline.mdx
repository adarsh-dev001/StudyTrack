## 🔑 How the 10-Day Challenge Works

The premise is simple: **Study every single day for 10 consecutive days.** What constitutes "study" is flexible but should involve focused effort towards your exam goals.

| 🗓️ Daily Task         | ✅ Action & Goal                                                                  |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commitment** | Decide on a minimum daily study duration (e.g., 60 minutes, 2 Pomodoros). Stick to it\! |
| **Define Your Focus** | Before each session, identify 1-2 specific topics or tasks you'll work on.           |
| **Eliminate Distractions** | Put your phone away, close irrelevant tabs, find a quiet space.                |
| **Track Your Streak** | Mark off each successful day on a calendar, app, or physical streak tracker.        |
| **Reflect & Adjust** | Briefly review what you learned and plan for the next day.                        |
| **No Zero Days\!** | Even 30 minutes is better than nothing if a full session isn't possible. Keep the streak alive\! |

\<Info title="What Counts as a 'Study' Session?"\>
A study session can be anything from focused reading, solving practice questions, revising notes, watching an educational video, or analyzing a mock test. The key is *active, intentional learning* dedicated to your exam preparation. Quality over quantity, but consistency is paramount\!

## 📈 Your Daily Playbook for Success

Here's a simple framework to follow each day of the challenge:

1.  **Morning Warm-up (5-10 min):**

      * Review your goal for the day.
      * Take a moment to visualize successfully completing your study session.

2.  **The Main Session (Your Committed Duration):**

      * **Use a Timer:** Whether it's the Pomodoro Technique (25-min study, 5-min break) or another timed method, stick to it. This helps maintain focus.
      * **Active Learning:** Don't just passively read. Take notes, make mind maps, solve problems, or teach the concept to an imaginary student.
      * **Stay Hydrated & Take Micro-Breaks:** Short breaks are essential for mental refreshment.

3.  **End-of-Day Review (5-10 min):**

      * **Mark Your Streak:** Immediately mark your streak tracker.
      * **Quick Recap:** Briefly recall what you studied.
      * **Plan for Tomorrow:** Jot down 1-2 key tasks for your next study session. This reduces friction for starting the next day.
