## Using Featured Images

This post demonstrates how to add a featured image to your blog posts using the `featuredImage` property in the frontmatter.

The image below is loaded from the URL specified in `featuredImage`:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
# ... other frontmatter ...
featuredImage: "https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg"
---
```

### How it Works:

1.  **Add the URL:** In the frontmatter of your `.mdx` file, add the `featuredImage` field and set its value to the direct URL of the image you want to display.
    *   You can use images hosted on services like Unsplash, Pexels, or any publicly accessible image URL.
    *   The example above uses a placeholder from `https://placehold.co`.

2.  **`next/image` Optimization:**
    *   The application uses Next.js's `next/image` component to display these images. This component automatically provides optimizations like:
        *   Resizing images for different screen sizes.
        *   Converting images to modern formats (like WebP).
        *   Lazy loading images for better performance.

3.  **Domain Configuration (Important for External Images):**
    *   For `next/image` to optimize images from external domains, those domains must be whitelisted in the `remotePatterns` section of your `next.config.ts` file.
    *   Currently, `placehold.co` is configured. If you use images from other domains (e.g., `images.unsplash.com`, `cdn.yourhost.com`), you'll need to add them.

    Example `next.config.ts` update:
    ```javascript
    images: {
      remotePatterns: [
        {
          protocol: 'https',
          hostname: 'placehold.co',
          port: '',
          pathname: '/**',
        },
        { // Add a new pattern for Unsplash
          protocol: 'https',
          hostname: 'images.unsplash.com',
          port: '',
          pathname: '/**',
        }
      ],
    },
    ```

### Long-Term Strategy

While using external URLs is great for getting started, for long-term scalability and control, consider:
*   **Firebase Storage:** Upload images here and use their public URLs. Integrates well with your existing Firebase setup.
*   **Dedicated Image CDN (e.g., Cloudinary):** Offers advanced optimization and transformation features.
*   **Headless CMS:** If you manage blog content this way, many offer built-in image handling.

By adding the `featuredImage` URL to your posts, they will now display correctly. Remember to configure any new image domains in `next.config.ts`!
