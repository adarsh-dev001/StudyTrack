## Introduction

Mathematics in JEE can be time-consuming. Knowing some smart shortcuts can give you a significant edge. Here are five useful tricks:

## 1. L'Hôpital's Rule for Limits

When faced with indeterminate forms like 0/0 or ∞/∞ in limits, L'Hôpital's Rule can be a lifesaver.
Differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately and then take the limit.

Example: `lim (x->0) sin(x)/x` becomes `lim (x->0) cos(x)/1 = 1`.

<Tip title="Caution!">
  Ensure the conditions for L'Hôpital's Rule are met before applying it.
</Tip>

## 2. Properties of Determinants for Quick Evaluation

Instead of expanding large determinants, use properties to simplify them.
*   If two rows/columns are identical, the determinant is 0.
*   R_i -> R_i + kR_j or C_i -> C_i + kC_j doesn't change the value.

## 3. Sum of Roots in Quadratic & Cubic Equations

For a quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, sum of roots (α+β) = -b/a, product of roots (αβ) = c/a.
This can help solve problems without finding the actual roots.

## 4. Short Tricks for Integration

*   Remember standard integral forms.
*   Substitution method for complex integrals.
*   Integration by parts (ILATE rule).

  Practice is key to mastering these integration shortcuts.

## 5. Vedic Math for Faster Calculations

Techniques from Vedic Mathematics can speed up multiplication, division, and finding squares/cubes.
Example: Multiplying numbers near a base (e.g., 98 x 97).

<Warning title="Accuracy First">
  While speed is important, never sacrifice accuracy. Double-check if time permits.
</Warning>

Mastering these shortcuts requires consistent practice. Integrate them into your regular problem-solving to make them second nature. Good luck!
