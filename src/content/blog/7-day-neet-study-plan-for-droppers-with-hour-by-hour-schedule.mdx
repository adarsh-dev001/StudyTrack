Preparing for NEET as a dropper requires dedication, a smart strategy, and a well-structured study plan. This 7-day plan is designed to help you cover key areas effectively, with suggestions for an hour-by-hour breakdown. Remember to adjust this plan based on your strengths, weaknesses, and the time remaining for your exam.

## Key Principles for Droppers:

*   **Consistency is Crucial**: Stick to your schedule as much as possible.
*   **Revision**: Regular revision of concepts already learned is vital.
*   **Mock Tests**: Incorporate mock tests and analyze your performance.
*   **Health**: Don't neglect sleep, nutrition, and short breaks.

**Hour-by-Hour Breakdown Idea within a Time Slot (e.g., Morning 6 AM - 12 PM = 6 hours):**

*   **6:00 AM - 6:30 AM**: Wake up, Freshen up
*   **6:30 AM - 8:30 AM**: Study Session 1 (e.g., Physics Concept Learning - 2h)
*   **8:30 AM - 9:00 AM**: Short Break & Breakfast
*   **9:00 AM - 10:30 AM**: Study Session 2 (e.g., Physics Problem Solving - 1.5h)
*   **10:30 AM - 10:45 AM**: Quick Break
*   **10:45 AM - 12:00 PM**: Study Session 3 (e.g., Biology Chapter Reading - 1.25h)

*(Adjust these micro-slots based on Pomodoro cycles or your preferred focus intervals.)*

This is a template. The key to success is consistent effort and smart adaptation. Tailor this plan to your specific needs, focus on your weak areas, and don't forget to take care of your health. Good luck!
