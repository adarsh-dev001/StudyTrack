**Key Elements of this Routine:**

1.  **Subject Alternation:** Avoid studying one subject for too long to maintain focus.
2.  **Pomodoro Technique:** Use 25-minute study sessions with 5-minute breaks for Study Blocks 1, 2, and 3. Take a longer 15-20 minute break after 4 Pomodoros.
3.  **Active Recall:** Dedicate time for revision and analyzing mock tests.
4.  **NCERT Focus:** Biology and Chemistry sections emphasize NCERT, which is crucial for NEET.
5.  **Problem-Solving:** Physics block is dedicated to numericals and conceptual application.
6.  **Breaks & Sleep:** Adequate rest is non-negotiable for optimal brain function.

Integrate this routine with your **StudyTrack planner** to schedule tasks, set reminders, and track your progress. Good luck!
