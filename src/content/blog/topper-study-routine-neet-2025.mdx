## 🧠 Subject-Wise Tips from NEET Toppers

### Biology 🧬

<Tip title="NCERT is Key">
Stick to NCERT religiously. 90%+ of questions are direct or twisted from NCERT.
</Tip>

- Make micro-notes and revise them weekly.
- Use Pomodoro: 25 mins reading, 5 mins break, repeat x4, then take a longer break.

### Physics ⚙️

<Info title="Concept Clarity First">
Focus on concepts + formulae first, then move to MCQs.
</Info>

- Practice at least 50 numericals/day.
- Use a tracker: “Chapters completed, accuracy % in mock tests”.

### Chemistry 🧪

<Warning title="Divide and Conquer">
Divide into Physical, Organic, Inorganic.
</Warning>

- For Organic: Master reaction mechanisms.
- For Physical: Practice numericals with time tracking.

## 🔥 Use a Study Tracker for Consistency

Top students use a planner or app to:

- Log daily hours per subject
