## Key Metrics to Monitor with StudyTrack ðŸ“Š

StudyTrack provides several tools to help you gather and visualize important data:

1.  **Weekly Study Hours:**
    *   **What it tells you:** Your overall time commitment and consistency.
    *   **StudyTrack Tool:** Check your Dashboard and the `Weekly Study Hours Chart` in Analytics (sample data for now, but imagine your own!).
    *   **Tip:** Aim for consistency but also listen to your body. If hours drop, investigate why.

2.  **Topics Completed:**
    *   **What it tells you:** Your pace of covering the syllabus and whether you're meeting your goals.
    *   **StudyTrack Tool:** Track this in your planner and see trends with the `Topics Completed Chart` in Analytics (again, visualize with your data!).
    *   **Tip:** âœ… Break down large subjects into smaller, manageable topics to track completion more effectively.

3.  **Subject-wise Time Distribution:**
    *   **What it tells you:** How much time you're dedicating to each subject. Is it aligned with the subject's importance or your performance in it?
    *   **StudyTrack Tool:** The `Subject Time Distribution Chart` (pie chart ðŸ¥§) in Analytics visualizes this based on your completed tasks from the Study Planner.
    *   **Tip:** If you're spending a lot of time on a subject but not seeing progress, it might be time to change your study method for that subject.

4.  **Daily Study Streaks:**
    *   **What it tells you:** Your consistency in showing up daily, which is crucial for building habits.
    *   **StudyTrack Tool:** The "Study Streaks" page keeps track of this.
    *   **Tip:** ðŸ”¥ Even a short, focused session counts towards your streak. It's about the habit, not just the hours!

## Interpreting Your Data for Actionable Insights ðŸ§ 

Data is only useful if you know how to interpret it. Here are some questions to ask yourself when looking at your analytics:

*   **Trends Over Time:** Are your study hours increasing, decreasing, or stable? Is your topic completion rate improving?
*   **Planned vs. Actual:** If you plan your sessions, how often do you stick to your plan? Where are the discrepancies?
*   **Effort vs. Outcome:** Are there subjects where you spend a lot of time but complete fewer topics or score lower in practice tests? This could indicate a need for a different approach.
*   **Balance:** Is your time distribution across subjects appropriate for your exam's weightage and your personal needs?
