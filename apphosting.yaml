# Environment variables (including NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_... and any others like STORAGE_BUCKET)
# should now be set directly in the Firebase App Hosting console's "Settings" tab.
#
# If you have server-side secrets (like third-party API keys not for client-side Firebase)
# that you want to load from Google Cloud Secret Manager, you would add them back here
# under an 'env:' section. For example:
#
# env:
#   - variable: MY_THIRD_PARTY_API_KEY
#     secret: nameOfYourSecretInSecretManagerForThirdPartyKey
#     availability: # Typically RUNTIME for server-side secrets not needed at build
#       - RUNTIME
